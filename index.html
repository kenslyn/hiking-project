            <h3>Alberta, big sky country</h3>
            <p>
              Encompassing mountains, prairies, desert badlands, vast forests,
              glaciers and more than 600 lakes, nestled between British Columbia
              and Saskatchewan, Alberta is a province of wide open spaces and
              stunning contrasts. Alberta should be your next dream destination
              and why it's Canada's best-kept secret.

              Alberta is home to several national parks, including Banff
              National Park and Jasper National Park. These parks offer a wealth
              of opportunities for hiking, camping, and wildlife watching. The
              largest national park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Jasper
              National Park is a place of pure magic. Here, shimmering glaciers,
              abundant wildlife, crystal-clear lakes, thundering waterfalls,
              deep canyons, evergreen forests and towering mountains set the
              scene for adventure.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Mackenzie and I've been living in Alberta for
              several years. I'm very fond of the province I call home. I
              created this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to
              develop my coding skills.
