            <h3>Alberta, big sky country</h3>
            <p>
              Encompassing mountains, prairies, desert badlands, vast forests,
              glaciers and more than 600 lakes, nestled between British Columbia
              and Saskatchewan, Alberta is a province of wide open spaces and
              stunning contrasts. Alberta should be your next dream destination
              and why it's Canada's best-kept secret.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alberta is home to several national parks, including Banff
              National Park and Jasper National Park. These parks offer a wealth
              of opportunities for hiking, camping, and wildlife watching. The
              largest national park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Jasper
              National Park is a place of pure magic. Here, shimmering glaciers,
              abundant wildlife, crystal-clear lakes, thundering waterfalls,
              deep canyons, evergreen forests and towering mountains set the
              scene for adventure.

                <h4>Ha Ling Trail</h4>
                <p>
                  The Ha Ling Trail to Ha Ling Peak is a difficult trail that
                  hikers confirm lives up to the challenge. The trail begins at
                  a parking lot and makes its way through beautiful Canadian
                  Rocky Mountain forest, as it starts to climb and then makes
                  its way onto open rock and fewer trees.

                <p>
                  Once at the ridge, the view is awesome as you tower over the
                  town of Canmore, with the accomplishment of having climbed the
                  striking mountain.

                <h4>Pocaterra Ridge</h4>
                <p>
                  Pocaterra Ridge is a beautiful and rewarding day hike and is
                  one of the most popular hikes in Kananaskis - particularly in
                  the fall when the famous larch trees begin to turn yellow
                  (typically around the last two weeks in September). It is a
                  steep climb with amazing views.

                  Seeing the beautiful larches turn into their golden yellow
                  spread across the hiking trail and stunning views of the Spray
                  Lakes.

                <h4>Tent Ridge Horseshoe</h4>
                <p>
                  This trail is a moderately challenging hike that hikers enjoy
                  completing clockwise for more of an easy hike, and
                  counter-clockwise as challenge. While the scrambling section
                  up to Tent Ridge summit is between beginner to intermediate
                  level, there is quite a bit of elevation to it.

                  The out-of-this-world views are very distracting though, so
                  make sure to pause and stand to enjoy the view rather than
                  gawking and walking at the same time.
