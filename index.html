            <h3>Alberta, big sky country</h3>
            <p>
              Encompassing mountains, prairies, desert badlands, vast forests,
              glaciers and more than 600 lakes, nestled between British Columbia
              and Saskatchewan, Alberta is a province of wide open spaces and
              stunning contrasts. Alberta should be your next dream destination
              and why it's Canada's best-kept secret.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alberta is home to several national parks, including Banff
              National Park and Jasper National Park. These parks offer a wealth
              of opportunities for hiking, camping, and wildlife watching. The
              largest national park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Jasper
              National Park is a place of pure magic. Here, shimmering glaciers,
              abundant wildlife, crystal-clear lakes, thundering waterfalls,
              deep canyons, evergreen forests and towering mountains set the
              scene for adventure.

                <p>
                  The Ha Ling Trail to Ha Ling Peak is a difficult trail that
                  hikers confirm lives up to the challenge. The trail begins at
                  a parking lot and makes its way through beautiful Canadian
                  Rocky Mountain forest, as it starts to climb and then makes
                  its way onto open rock and fewer trees.

                  Once at the ridge, the view is awesome as you tower over the
                  town of Canmore, with the accomplishment of having climbed the
                  striking mountain.

                <p>
                  Pocaterra Ridge is a beautiful and rewarding day hike and is
                  one of the most popular hikes in Kananaskis - particularly in
                  the fall when the famous larch trees begin to turn yellow
                  (typically around the last two weeks in September). It is a
                  steep climb with amazing views.

                  Seeing the beautiful larches turn into their golden yellow
                  spread across the hiking trail and stunning views of the Spray
                  Lakes.

                <h4>Tent Ridge Horseshoe</h4>
                <p>
                  This trail is a moderately challenging hike that hikers enjoy
                  completing clockwise for more of an easy hike, and
                  counter-clockwise as challenge. While the scrambling section
                  up to Tent Ridge summit is between beginner to intermediate
                  level, there is quite a bit of elevation to it.

                  The out-of-this-world views are very distracting though, so
                  make sure to pause and stand to enjoy the view rather than
                  gawking and walking at the same time.
